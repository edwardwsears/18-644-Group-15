\section{The Problem}

    Public transporation can be an important asset to any city. If widely 
used, it can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and more 
importantly provide transportation for those who do not have cars.  
However, in Pittsburgh (and many other cities across the country) 
the public transportation is very unreliable.  The bus system posts 
schedules, but can rarely stick to them.  This can cause up to an 
hour delay between the scheduled time and the bus arrival time.  For 
many people, this uncertainty makes the bus system practically unusable.  
Because of this, fewer and fewer people are using public transportation 
regularly.  This results in the bus company earning less revenue and 
consequently reducing the number of bus routs.  If this trend continues, 
bus companies will not be able to stay in business, leaving many people 
without any mode of transportation.

\section{Our Idea}

We wish to predict bus arrival times via GPS tracking of all buses in Pittsburgh.
GPS modules placed on each bus would transmit the buses coordinates to a server
application via cell networks. The server could then serve bus location data
to users via the internet, who may be accessing the data through their mobile
devices.

While GPS data will let users know where buses are, it may not let them
know how long it will take for the bus to arrive at their stop. The user will
not be able to know if the bus is stuck in traffic, or if it will arrive within
a reasonable amount of time. The Pittsburgh bus schedule already shows how long
it usually takes for a bus to travel between stops. In the absence of traffic,
this data can be used to determine when the bus will arrive, based on its current
position along the route.

In order to give users accurate results regardless of conditions, traffic patterns
must be gathered in real time, or be based on a record of past traffic patterns.
One approach which we are considering taking is the use of Google traffic data.
By querying Google traffic data in real time along the buses route, the
appropriate traffic delay can be added based on the situation. The other approach
we are considering would be to accumulate a model of traffic patterns over a 
time period. This data, accumulated from past bus runs, would allow arrival time
on a route to be predicted during a certain time of day. The actual position
data and journey times of buses could be used to make the model more accurate. 
For the time period used for the model, longer time periods would allow more 
accurate predictions, but shorter time periods allow for faster adaption and 
deployment. We've determined that the best compromise would be week-long cycles.

The hardware module would require a GPS receiver, a processing unit, and a
cellular modem. For our proof of concept, we will use an Arduino for the
processing unit. For the modem component, we will use an inexpensive cell
phone connected to a circuit board which can access the cellular modem
via the phone serial port.

\section{Benefits of Our Idea}

-Reliable, uses hw not crowdsourcing
-Easily set up in any city (if routs tied into google maps)
-Cost effective
